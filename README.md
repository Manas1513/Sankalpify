## üîß How to Customize

This project is designed to be easily customizable. All content, including text, images, and course details, is located within the `index.html` file.

### Changing Course Details

To edit course information (like syllabus or pricing), search for the \`\` comment within `index.html`. Each course has a dedicated \`\<div\>\` with an ID like \`page-course-dsa\`. You can edit the text and pricing directly within these sections.

### Updating the Gallery

1.  Place your four image files (e.g., `my_photo.jpg`) in the same root folder as `index.html`.
2.  In `index.html`, scroll to the bottom `<script>` tag and find the `initGallery` function.
3.  Update the `images` array with your filenames:
    ```javascript
    // === EDIT THIS ARRAY TO CHANGE YOUR GALLERY PHOTOS ===
    const images = [ 'your_image_1.jpg', 'your_image_2.png', 'your_image_3.jpg', 'your_image_4.jpeg' ];
    // =====================================================
    ```

### Updating the Enrollment Link

The "Register Now" buttons link to a Google Form. To change this link:

1.  Search for `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeojCeISaPTHJvp87ivPM9PA31QqBUAoIxglE9ILmRHD1OAjw/viewform?usp=dialog` in the `index.html` file.
2.  Replace this URL with your new link in all 5 locations.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is a static website, making it incredibly easy to deploy.

### Deploying with GitHub Pages

1.  Push the entire project folder to a new GitHub repository.
2.  In your repository's settings, go to the "Pages" tab.
3.  Under "Build and deployment," select the source as **"Deploy from a branch."**
4.  Choose the branch your code is on (e.g., `main`) and the folder as `/ (root)`.
5.  Click **"Save."** Your website will be live at the provided URL in a few minutes.
